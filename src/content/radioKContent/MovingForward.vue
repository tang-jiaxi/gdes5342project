  <h1>Moving forward</h1>
  <p>The podcast website navigation is only one part of the podcast experience.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Improve integration between different platforms</li>
    <p>Potential to find a better ‘home’ in the larger RadioK website, and a better call-to-action from social media platforms</p>
    <li>Include advanced features</li>
    <p>E.g. favorites playlist, queue system on website</p>
    <li>Additional user testing</li>
    <p>Before carrying on with further designs, collecting more user insights will ensure that we learn fast and fail fast</p>
