  <h1>UI Design Process</h1>
  <p>I wasnâ€™t as knowledgable about the fashion design process, so I seeked to understand my users first.</p>
  <p>My moodboard focuses on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>UI of apps that fashion designers liked to use</li>
    <li>UI of apps with data visualization/qualitative analytics</li>
  </ul>
